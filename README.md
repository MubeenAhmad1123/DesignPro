<b>🎨 DesignPro — Creative Design Academy Website</b>

DesignPro is a visually rich, animation-driven landing page built as a client-style demo project for a creative design academy.
The focus of this project was motion design, layout polish, and presenting complex content in a clean, engaging way.

This project helped me explore advanced UI animations, scroll-based interactions, and conversion-focused layout design.
